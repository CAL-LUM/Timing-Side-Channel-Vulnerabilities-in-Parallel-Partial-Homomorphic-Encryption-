# Timing Side-Channel Vulnerabilities in Parallel Partial Homomorphic Encryption

BSc Cyber Security Dissertation — University of Gloucestershire, 2026 by Callum Liddell

## Overview

This repository contains the full implementation, experimental results, and dissertation for an investigation into timing side-channel vulnerabilities introduced through parallelism in Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) algorithms.

## Problem Statement
Current advancements in Partial Homomorphic Encryption have largely been driven by  the need for greater computational efficiency and yet security considerations of optimisation methods, such as parallel processing, remain unexplored. As a result, existing implementations risk introducing novel attack vectors and compromising the integrity of encrypted data. 

## Proposed solution
This research addresses the identified gap through a structured three-part approach. Firstly, a Paillier-based e-voting system is implemented in three configurations, sequential baseline, unprotected parallel and secure parallel, to expose and characterise timing side-channel leakage vectors introduced through parallelism. A Candidate-Partitioned TVLA based analytical framework is developed to evaluate leakage systematically, adapting a hardware-oriented methodology to a software timing context. Finally, three structural countermeasures targeting each identified leakage vector are proactively implemented and evaluated for both effectiveness in eliminating leakage and impact on computational overhead relative to an unprotected baseline.

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Go implementation

```bash
cd "Go Implementation"
go run main.go
```

This generates three CSV files in `results/`:
- `sequential_timings.csv`
- `parallel_timings.csv`
- `secure_timings.csv`

By default, each system runs 10,000 measurement repetitions. This takes approximately 30–60 minutes depending on hardware. See `README_main.md` for configuration options.

### 2. Run the Python analysis

```bash
cd "Python Analysis"
pip install pandas scipy matplotlib seaborn numpy
python analysis.py
```

This reads the CSVs from `results/` and produces the full TVLA report, descriptive statistics and overhead analysis See `README_analysis.md` for full output details.

## The Three Systems

| System | Description | Countermeasures |
| Sequential | Single-goroutine baseline | None |
| Parallel | Concurrent decryption, one goroutine per candidate | None |
| Secure | Concurrent decryption with proactive hardening | CM1 + CM2 + CM3 |

### Countermeasures

| ID | Name | Leakage vector addressed |
| CM1 | Ciphertext blinding | Input-dependent timing from ciphertext bit-pattern variation |
| CM2 | Synchronisation barrier | Scheduling state divergence from staggered goroutine launch |
| CM3 | Constant-time padding | Completion-time ordering observable to a network adversary |

## The CP-TVLA Framework

The **Candidate-Partitioned Test Vector Leakage Assessment** (CP-TVLA) framework is a novel adaptation of the TVLA methodology (Goodwill et al., 2011) to a software timing context. Standard TVLA partitions traces into fixed vs random input sets; CP-TVLA partitions by candidate identity instead, which maps directly to the e-voting threat model where an adversary seeks to infer relative vote totals from decryption timing.

Four adaptations distinguish CP-TVLA from standard TVLA:

1. **Candidate-identity partitioning** — traces grouped by candidate rather than fixed/random
2. **Dual independent metrics** — `duration_ns` (wall-clock) and `cpu_cycles` (computational work) captured simultaneously for cross-validation
3. **N-Progressive monotonicity testing** — t-statistics evaluated at three run counts to distinguish genuine signals from statistical fluctuations
4. **Cross-system validation** — framework sensitivity confirmed against known architectural differences before security-critical within-system comparisons

A violation is defined as `|t| > 4.5`, corresponding to a false-positive rate of approximately 1 in 100,000 under the null hypothesis.

## Key Results

Applied to 150,000 decryption timing records (N = 10,000 runs per candidate across three systems):

- **0/20 within-system violations** sustained across both metrics in both the unprotected parallel and hardened secure systems
- **Non-monotonic t-statistic progression** at all three run counts confirms intermediate peaks are sampling fluctuations rather than emerging signals
- **9.3% mean computational overhead** for the secure system above the unprotected parallel baseline, attributable primarily to CM1 ciphertext blinding
- CM3 constant-time padding contributes wall-clock latency but does not appear in `cpu_cycles`, confirming it operates outside the measurement window as intended

---

## Results Structure

Results are stored at three measurement counts to support N-progressive monotonicity analysis:

| Folder | Runs per candidate | Total records |
| `N = 1000` | 1,000 | 15,000 |
| `N = 5000` | 5,000 | 75,000 |
| `N = 10000` | 10,000 | 150,000 |

The `overhead_analysis.csv` file is only present in the `N = 10000` folder as it is calculated from the full dataset.

## Platform

The Go implementation is **Windows-specific** due to its dependency on `QueryPerformanceCounter` for nanosecond-resolution timing and `timeBeginPeriod` for improved system timer resolution. Running on Linux or macOS requires replacing the QPC timer with an equivalent high-resolution monotonic clock.

The Python analysis script is platform-independent.

## Research Questions

- **RQ1** — What timing side-channel vulnerabilities are introduced through parallel processing in the decryption phase of a Paillier-based e-voting system?
- **RQ2** — How can a candidate-partitioned TVLA framework be developed and applied to systematically evaluate side-channel leakage in parallel Paillier decryption?
- **RQ3** — How effective are proactively applied countermeasures at eliminating timing side-channel vulnerabilities, and what is their computational overhead?
